# module-product-label

Example of the module that I've started to develop in my fre time for my current company.

This module allows to assign image labels to products by rules. So they will be shown on product blocks on frontend.

But it is sill incomplete. Frontend part is not ready and also I want to add indexing for rules as it is implemented in Catalog Rules
